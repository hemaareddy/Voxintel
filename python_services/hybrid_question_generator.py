------------------------------
Phase 1 — Hybrid Personalized Interview Generation

Produces interview question lists that combine:
  60% Resume-Based Questions  — from skills, projects, experience, certifications
  40% Dataset-Based Questions — from the Node.js Question DB (passed in as JSON)

The Python service does NOT have direct DB access.
The Node.js caller passes the dataset questions as part of the request payload.

Distribution rules:
  10 questions → 6 resume + 4 dataset
  20 questions → 12 resume + 8 dataset
  Any N        → ceil(N * 0.6) resume + floor(N * 0.4) dataset

Source tracking:
  Every returned question has a "source" field: "resume" | "dataset"

Anti-duplication:
  Tracks used concepts to avoid semantic overlap.
